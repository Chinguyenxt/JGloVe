# JGloVe
A Java implementation of the GloVe algorithm

This is a Java implementation of the GloVe algorithm (http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) that was proposed by Pennington et al. in [GloVe - Global Vectors for Word Representation - (Pennington, Socher, Manning 2014)](http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf). Quoting from the original site "GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.". 
For my implementation, I found useful [this blogpost](http://www.foldl.me/2014/glove-python/)
